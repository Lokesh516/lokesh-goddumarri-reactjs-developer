# Lokesh Goddumarri ‚Äì ReactJS Developer Assessment

This is a multi-theme React application built as part of a frontend technical assessment. It demonstrates key ReactJS concepts including routing, authentication, context management, dynamic theming, and API integration using TypeScript and Vite.

## Features

- **Mock Authentication**: Login/logout functionality using mock user data.
- **Protected Routes**: Only logged-in users can access internal pages.
- **Fake Store Integration**: Product data fetched from fakestoreapi.com and displayed in card format.
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Separation of concerns with clearly organized folders for components, context, pages, and types.
